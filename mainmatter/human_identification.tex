This chapter introduces the background of human identification. Because of its rich values in real applications, human identification receives much research attentions in computer vision, which leads to various subtopics. In Section~\ref{sec:human-id-prob-settings}, we introduce different problem settings and evaluation metrics for human identification, as well as current research trend towards more realistic application scenarios. In Section~\ref{sec:human-id-tech-roadmap}, we develop a technical roadmap for human identification, and review some related work along this roadmap.
